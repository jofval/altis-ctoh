## Altimetry Time Series (AlTiS) Software


AlTiS is software developed by CTOH as part of its activities as a National Observation Service. Altis is free software and it is released as open source under the CeCill License, and is available for download free of charge. Altis is working under python3 environment (Anaconda distribution) and tested for GNU/Linux, Windows 10 (and soon for Mac OS X).
 
The AlTiS 1.4 (2020/11) has now identifier IDDN.FR.010.0121234.000.R.X.2020.041.30000  IDDN Certification
 

AlTiS software is developed for:
- Research : Analysis tool allowing altimetry data studies over small area like rivers, lakes, flood areas in order to create water time series.
- Training : Education tools to manipulate radar altimetry data and evaluate their potential to monitor water bodies.
