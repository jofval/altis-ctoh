## Altimetry Time Series (AlTiS) Software


AlTiS is software developed by [CTOH](http://ctoh.legos.obs-mip.fr/) as part of its activities as a National Observation Service. Altis is free software and it is released as open source under the [CeCill License](LICENSE), and is available for download free of charge. Altis is working under python3 environment ([Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com)) and tested for GNU/Linux, Windows 10 (and soon for Mac OS X).
 
The AlTiS 1.4 (2020/11) has now identifier IDDN.FR.010.0121234.000.R.X.2020.041.30000  IDDN Certification
 

AlTiS software is developed for:
- Research : Analysis tool allowing altimetry data studies over small area like rivers, lakes, flood areas in order to create water time series.
- Training : Education tools to manipulate radar altimetry data and evaluate their potential to monitor water bodies.
